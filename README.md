# NYC-Pedestrian-Safety-Analysis-Explorer-TDSP
NEBDHub &amp; NSDC Transportation Data Science Project: with the Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub (NEBDHub), National Student Data Corps (NSDC), and U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration

As part of the Explorer Transportation Data Science Project (TDSP), this research leverages data-driven insights to enhance pedestrian safety by analyzing incident patterns and identifying key risk factors. By examining transportation datasets, the study aims to develop targeted strategies to mitigate accidents and improve road safety.

This project integrates Python-based data analysis, visualization, and geospatial mapping to uncover trends in pedestrian-related incidents. Utilizing NYC OpenData, the research employs Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data exploration, while GeoPandas and Folium enable geospatial and time-series analysis to identify high-risk zones. Interactive dashboards and reports were developed to present findings effectively, offering actionable recommendations for stakeholders.

Conducted as part of an accelerated research program, this initiative provided hands-on experience in data science, fostering collaboration with experts and peers to refine data-driven safety strategies. The project was made possible through the joint efforts of the Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub (NEBDHub), the National Student Data Corps (NSDC), and the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration.
